To Do

The DHT is fully functional and ready to use (I hope) but it's still a bit 
rough around the edges. A few things are missing and others are maybe not
practical in the sense of usability. These things will get straightened out
as the project matures and more use-cases for it emerge. In the mean time
have fun and contribute back if you can. Thanks!
